Scatter Lab is a South Korean technology company pioneering the future of AI-powered entertainment through advanced 
natural language processing and generative AI. The company is best known for `Zeta`, an immersive AI chat-based 
entertainment platform launched in April 2024.

Zeta redefines user engagement by enabling users to co-create dynamic, personalized narratives with AI 
characters—shifting entertainment from passive consumption to active, real-time collaboration. Within its first year, 
Zeta surpassed 2 million cumulative users and 800,000 monthly active users, with users spending an average of over 2 
hours and 40 minutes per day on the app.

At the core of Zeta is Spotwrite-1, Scatter Lab’s proprietary AI model optimized not just for coherence, but for 
fun—leveraging creativity, unpredictability, and even controlled “hallucinations” to deliver compelling experiences. 
The company has achieved vertical integration across data, training, and application layers, enabling both high 
performance and cost efficiency.

Notably, Scatter Lab has been profitable for six consecutive quarters since Q4 2024, demonstrating a rare combination of 
rapid growth and sustainable monetization in the AI consumer space.

With a vision to make AI a true companion in human storytelling, Scatter Lab is expanding Zeta globally, starting with 
Japan, and shaping the next generation of AI-native entertainment.
